# Lagrange points

Simple interactive webpage displaying Lagrange points and effective potential of two massive objects.
The effective potential is given by
$$  V_{\mathrm{ef}} = -G M \left( \frac{1-\alpha}{\sqrt{(x + \alpha a)^2 + y^2}} + \frac{\alpha}{\sqrt{(x - (1- \alpha) a)^2 + y^2}}\right)$$
where $M = m_1 + m_2$ is the sum of masses, $a$ is the distance of masses, $\alpha$ is
